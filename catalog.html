There are approximately 1,500 species of Solanum in the world,<br>    with eighteen found in California. Many are toxic, and many are good foods.<br>    Description: S. americanum (aka S. nodiflorum), S. douglasit, and S. xanti are native<br>    nightshades; S. nigrum is not. S. americanum and S. nigrum are very similar<br>    and sometimes difficult to distinguish from one another. The very young plant<br>    resembles lambsquarters, except that the nightshade doesn\'t have an erect stem.<br>    Rather, it\'s more widely branched. Also, though the individual leaves of both<br>    nightshade and lambsquarters are quite similar, the nightshade lacks the mealy<br>    coating of the lambsquarters\', and lacks the often noticeable red in the axil of<br>    the leaf, which is common in lambsquarters. The five-petaled white to lavender<br>    flower is a very typical Nightshade family flower, resembling the flowers of garden<br>    tomatoes.

The flowers<br>    are white and five-petaled, and are followed by the fruits, which are aggregate fruits.<br>    Most people instantly recognize the shape of the blackberry because they\'ve seen it<br>    in the supermarket or in the backyard garden. The aggregate fruit is a collection of<br>    sweet drupelets, with the fruit separating from the flower stalk to form a somewhat<br>    hollow, thimblelike shape.<br>    <br>    Uses: The ripe fruits are eaten fresh, or made into a variety of jams, jellies, and<br>    juices. The leaves are sometimes used medicinally. Made into an infusion, the leaf<br>    tea can be used to treat cases of mild diarrhea. Gargling with an infusion of<br>    blackberry leaf is also good for mouth irritations, such as bleeding gums or sore<br>    throat.<br>    <br>    Habitats: The Rubus species and their kin are fairly widespread and distributed<br>    throughout the state.

The clusters of orange-<br>    red fruit ripen from about November into January.<br>    <br>    Uses: Berries are cooked, dried, or made into flour.<br>    <br>    Habitats: Chaparral hillsides, canyons, and slopes; sometimes cultivated.<br>    <br>    Range: Found throughout the state, mostly in the western half.<br>    <br>    Tools: Just a bag for collecting the berries.<br>    <br>    "},{"name":"Madrone","description":" Madrone is a shrub or tree with reddish bark that is typically shedding<br>    and curling. The leaves are alternate, leathery, and evergreen. Each leaf is oblong to<br>    ovate, 4 to 5 inches long, with small and shallow serrations. The white or pinkish<br>    flower petals are fused into a very characteristic down-hanging urn shape. The<br>    distinctive fruit is round, about ⅓ to ½ inch diameter, and orange red. The fruit is<br>    papillate, which means it is uniformly covered with small roundish bumps.<br>    <br>    Uses: The fruits are used for food.<br>    <br>    Habitats: Typically found in conifer and oak forests, usually in the lower elevations.<br>    <br>    Range: From approximately Santa Barbara northward, more common the farther<br>    north you go.

The sepals and the petals are similar, usually in five whorls. The<br>    approximately ¼-inch fruits are bluish to purple berries, and are tightly arranged in<br>    clusters that resemble tiny grapes.<br>    <br>    Uses: Fruits can be eaten, or made into wine, jams, jellies.<br>    <br>    Habitats: Coniferous forests, slopes, canyons, oak woodlands, chaparral.<br>    <br>    Range: Found throughout California, but less common south of Santa Barbara.<br>    <br>    Tools: Collecting bag<br>    <br>    "},{"name":"Prickly Pear","description":" Prickly pear cacti are readily recognized by their flat oval pads, with<br>    spines evenly spaced over their surface. The cacti flower by summer, and then the<br>    fruits mature by August and September. The fruits mature in a variety of colors,<br>    ranging from green (less common) to yellow, orange, red, and purple. Each of these<br>    fruits has a different flavor, and was traditionally used in different recipes.<br>    <br>    Uses: Young pads for food, raw or cooked; fruits for deserts and juices; seeds for<br>    flour. Nearly all species of Opuntia have a long history of being used for food.<br>    <br>    Habitats: Typically found in the desert regions, but also commonly found in<br>    chaparral, dry fields, along the coast, and commonly cultivated.<br>    <br>    Range: Fairly widespread throughout the state, very common in certain areas. like<br>    the desert, chaparral, and where it is cultivated in urban or farm areas.<br>    <br>    Tools: Metal tongs, sturdy bucket, possibly gloves.<br>    <br>    Cautions: Occasionally, people have experienced sickness after eating certain<br>    varieties of prickly pear. In some cases, this is due to a negative reaction to the<br>    mucilaginous quality. According to Dr. Leonid Enari, the entire Cactus family is<br>    very safe for consumption. However, he would quickly add that some are much too<br>    woody for food. A very few are extremely bitter even after boiling and you\'d not<br>    even consider using them for food. If you choose to experiment, just remember that<br>    palatability is the key.
